 **Task 1: Even or Odd Checker**

This little program helps the user figure out if a number is **even** or **odd**.

Here’s what it does step by step:
1. It asks the user to **enter a number**.
2. If the user enters something that’s not a number (like text or symbols), it will say _“Not an integer! Try again.” and ask again.
3. Once a valid number is entered, it checks:
   - If the number is **even** (i.e., divisible by 2), it tells the user “number is an even number.”
   - If it’s not, it tells the user “number is an odd number.”_

**Task 2: Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50**

This program simply adds all the numbers starting from 1 up to 50 (because of a small bug — more on that in a second), and then prints the total sum.

Here’s how it works:
1. It sets `1` and `51`.
2. Then, using a **for loop**, it adds each number from 1 up to 50 to a total sum.
3. Finally, it prints the total.
